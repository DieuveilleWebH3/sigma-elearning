There are two ways to use this module:

Using the project as base and add other modules in it   


## 3.1 Starting New Project ##   

As a complementary module, the Account Module must be integrated in another project / website. 
    


## 3.2 Cloning this project ## 

We clone the specific repository or download the compressed project; the project contains the 
We open our project directory
We first install composer by running  composer install
We copy the  .env.example and rename it to  .env 
We then run  php artisan key:generate 
Finally we run  php artisan migrate. and  php artisan db:seed
